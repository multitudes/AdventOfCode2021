# Advent Of Code 2021 in Swift ‚ú®üèù  
 
## What is Advent of Code?
[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is an online event created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl). Each year an advent calendar of small programming puzzles is unlocked once a day, they can be solved in any programming language you like.

## Preparing the environment

[In 2019](https://github.com/multitudes/Advent-of-Code-2019/blob/master/README.md) I did the challenges in the Xcode Swift playgrounds.  
Last year I did use the playgrounds but also I wanted to try something different with the [Swift package manager](https://swift.org/getting-started/#using-the-package-manager).
You can read more in my blog post [here](https://laurentbrusa.hashnode.dev/preparing-xcode-for-the-advent-of-code-2020-in-swift).  

This year I am exploring the Xcode command line app.



## Advent of Code 2021 Story

You're minding your own business on a ship at sea when the overboard alarm goes off! You rush to see if you can help. Apparently, one of the Elves tripped and accidentally sent the sleigh keys flying into the ocean!

Before you know it, you're inside a submarine the Elves keep ready for situations like this. It's covered in Christmas lights (because of course it is), and it even has an experimental antenna that should be able to track the keys if you can boost its signal strength high enough; there's a little meter that indicates the antenna's signal strength by displaying 0-50 stars.

Your instincts tell you that in order to save Christmas, you'll need to get all fifty stars by December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star.

# A sort of diary

## Day 1 
This year I wanted to create a different work environment and try to use the command line app template in Xcode. Something I never use.
First obstacle: where is my input file?  
Mostly every challenge comes with an input file.  
Little did I know that this command line app template doesn‚Äôt come with a Bundle!  
If you are interested in thisthen please visit [my blog](https://laurentbrusa.hashnode.dev/setting-up-this-year-advent-of-code-2021-in-swift) to see how I solved this...  

Now back to the challenges...  
Part 1 could be solved this way, using `adjacentPairs` from the swift algorithm package, with a loop:

```swift
 var solutionDay1a = 0
 for pair in input.adjacentPairs() {
     if pair.0 < pair.1 {
         solutionDay1a += 1
     }
 }
```

Writing short code it is frowned upon and can sometimes be more difficult to read but it‚Äôs not always bad.  
In this case using functional programming: 
- it actually has a better performance because being optimised for fast execution, so operations on large arrays are performed lazily, it means that data is written when needed skipping intermediate steps.
- Functional programming can be better readable than longer chunk of code. For instance, when I see a map operator, I know that each element of an array is being transformed with the code in the body of the map without side effects. And the results are being passed to the next operator etc.  

Here I split my input array into adjacent pairs and each one is being reduced into one total sum. In each pair, I check wether the first variable is smaller than the second and if so I increment the total sum.

```swift
let solutionDay1a = input
    .adjacentPairs()
    .reduce(into: 0) {  total , pair  in
        total = (pair.0 < pair.1) ? total + 1 : total
    }
```

This can be written more tersely like this, but maybe is not very clear anymore what it is happening üôà

```swift
 let solutionDay1a = input.adjacentPairs().reduce(0) { 
    ($1.0 < $1.1) ? $0 + 1 : $0 
}
```

Part 2 is just like part 1, only that I look over a window of three measurements to check if the next window is bigger, then I increment my total. This again was not difficult using the algorithm package. There is `windows`function made specifically for this case. :)  

```swift
let solutionDay1b = input
        .windows(ofCount: 3)
        .map {$0.reduce(0,+)}
        .adjacentPairs()
        .reduce(into: 0) { partialResult, windowSums in
            partialResult = (windowSums.0 < windowSums.1) ? partialResult + 1 : partialResult
        }
```


## Day 2 

I decided to use tuples which are a great very descriptive and expressive swift feature together with an enum to move the submarine up down and forward. For part two I added some more functions to my model and one extra variable.
My model is a struct. I do not change the struct which is immutable but instead I return a new instance for every change...

```swift
let input: [(command: SubmarineCommand, amount: Int)] = getInputDay2()

let solutionDay2a = input.reduce(Position()) { position, course in
    switch course.command {
    case .forward:
        return position.increaseForward(horizontal: course.amount)
    case .down:
        return position.increaseDepth(depth: course.amount)
    case .up:
        return position.decreaseDepth(depth: course.amount)
    }
}.currentPositionResult
print("Solution day2 - Part1: \(solutionDay2a)")

let solutionDay2b = input.reduce(Position()) { position, course in
    switch course.command {
    case .forward:
        return position.increaseForwardWithAim(units: course.amount)
    case .down:
        return position.increaseAim(aim: course.amount)
    case .up:
        return position.decreaseAim(aim: course.amount)
    }
}.currentPositionResult

print("Solution day2 - Part2: \(solutionDay2b)")
```


## Day 3

I have binary numbers in input so I thought why not use bitwise operators instead of just using strings. The interesting thing is that the gammaRate and the epsilonRate in part 1 have inversed bit, and I could have also used the `NOT` or `~` bitwise operator. The only problem is that I have 12 bits in my puzzle input and it would work better if I had a UInt12. ex 1011010111011 is inverted 0100101000100. but the same input in Uint32 written down is 00001011010111011 and inverted is 11110100101000100! basically not what I need for the puzzle.  
More info about these operators are in the docs: [https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/AdvancedOperators.html](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/AdvancedOperators.html).  
Also the code is quite unreadable sometimes. Being used to read swift code which is expressive the below feels like coming from somewhere else... But it is fun!  
Bit difficult to comment this code. Better check on the website the original challenge if something is not clear :)

``` swift
/// I created this function which is reusable for part two... and uses bitwise operators to look which bits are ones or zeroes for a specific bitNumber and return the two arrays of ones and zeroes
func loopOn(array input: [String], bitNumber: Int) -> (ones: [String], zeroes: [String]) {
    /// initialise my counts
    var onesArray: [String] = []; var zeroesArray: [String] = []
    /// looping on the inputs
    for binary in input {
        /// my binary input transformed from string to Int
        let binaryInt = UInt(binary, radix: 2)!
        
        /// I do a logic AND between my binary and the current bit like
        /// ex binary is 11011 and my i is 5 I will compare the two:
        /// 11011 & 10000 which will give 10000 = 16
        /// I look only for zeroes first ... because practical
        if (binaryInt & (2 << (bitNumber - 2))) == 0 {
            zeroesArray.append(binary)
        } else {
            onesArray.append(binary)
        }
    }
    return (onesArray, zeroesArray)
}

/// bitwise operation - If I have 5 bits I will start from 5, then 4 ... till one
for bitNumber in stride(from: numberOfBits, to: 0, by: -1) {
    /// `loopOn()` returns two arrays of strings, the one that passed the test to have a one at the bitnumber position and the ones with the zeroes for each bit number position passed down in the for loop
    let (ones, zeroes) = loopOn(array: input, bitNumber: bitNumber)
    /// at the end of my loop on the inputs I check if the ones were more than the  zeroes
    if ones.count > zeroes.count {
        /// again bitwise operations here. I am still using my stride as comparing the bit positions,
        /// so if i = 5, this means 10000, and 2 << (5 - 2) is 10000
        gammaRate += (2 << (bitNumber - 2))
    } else {
        epsilonRate += (2 << (bitNumber - 2))
    }
}
powerConsumption = gammaRate * epsilonRate
let solutionDay2a = powerConsumption
```
For part 2 I need to iterate on the arrays sequentially again, only that the arrays are being filtered, so I will keep on iterating until I have only one value left. I thought of using the `zip` swift operator but that one would not do because the arrays do not have the same length. I could use padding but this is extra work and is not making the code better.

```swift
/// this will be my solution
var lifeSupportRating = 0

/// optional because converting a string to int will be always an optional anyway
var oxygenGeneratorRating: Int? = nil
var co2ScrubberRating: Int? = nil

/// initialize my arrays to loop on - at the beginning they will have both the same input
var oxygenGeneratorRatingArray: [String] = input
var co2ScrubberRatingArray: [String] = input

/// This just for clarity. I have two cases for the rating and I will calculate them separately in the same function below
enum Rating {
    case oxygen, co2
}

/// convenience function. I will update the array in inpit depending if I am looking for oxigen rating or co2 rating.
func updateRatingsArray(inputArray input: [String], for rating: Rating, bitNumber: Int) -> [String] {
    let (onesArray, zeroesArray) = loopOn(array: input, bitNumber: bitNumber)

    switch rating {
    case .oxygen:
        /// at the end of my loop on the inputs I check if the ones were more than the  zeroes
        if onesArray.count >= zeroesArray.count {
            print("oxygenGeneratorRatingArray ones are more - bit nr \(bitNumber) \(onesArray)")
            return onesArray
        } else {
            print("oxygenGeneratorRatingArray zeroes are more - bit nr \(bitNumber) \(onesArray)")
            return zeroesArray
        }
    case .co2:
        /// at the end of my loop on the inputs I check if the ones were more than the  zeroes
        if zeroesArray.count <= onesArray.count   {
            print("co2ScrubberRatingArray zeroes are more - bit nr \(bitNumber) \(zeroesArray)")
            return zeroesArray
        } else {
            print("co2ScrubberRatingArray zeroes are less - bit nr \(bitNumber) \(onesArray)")
            return onesArray
        }
    }
}
/// again using the stride looping on the bits
for bitNumber in stride(from: numberOfBits, to: 0, by: -1) {
    /// I only update my array if it is not empty - I might have the solution already for the other array but not for all
    if !oxygenGeneratorRatingArray.isEmpty {
        oxygenGeneratorRatingArray = updateRatingsArray(inputArray: oxygenGeneratorRatingArray, for: .oxygen, bitNumber: bitNumber)}
    /// Here i have a solution and I update my property with a value
    if oxygenGeneratorRatingArray.count == 1 {
        oxygenGeneratorRating = Int(oxygenGeneratorRatingArray[0], radix: 2 )
    }
    /// I only update my array if it is not empty
    if !co2ScrubberRatingArray.isEmpty {
        co2ScrubberRatingArray = updateRatingsArray(inputArray: co2ScrubberRatingArray, for: .co2, bitNumber: bitNumber)}
    /// Here i have a solution and I update my property with a value
    if co2ScrubberRatingArray.count == 1 {
        co2ScrubberRating = Int(co2ScrubberRatingArray[0], radix: 2)
    }
    /// if they are both non nil... then I can break
    if let oxygenGeneratorRating = oxygenGeneratorRating,
        let co2ScrubberRating = co2ScrubberRating {
        lifeSupportRating = oxygenGeneratorRating * co2ScrubberRating
        break
    }
}

let solutionDay2b = lifeSupportRating

```

## Day 4
Playing Bingo with the squid. Getting the correct input was trickier than I thought. Maybe I underestimaterd it and lost time debugging it when it did not work as espected.  
This is to get the input. I return a tuple, The bingo numbers and the boards:  

```swift
if let inputFileURL = bundle?.url(forResource: "input-4", withExtension: "txt") {
            do {
                numbers = try String(contentsOf: inputFileURL)
                    .components(separatedBy: .newlines)
                    .prefix(1)
                    .flatMap({ $0.components(separatedBy: ",").compactMap { Int(String($0)) } })
                boards = try String(contentsOf: inputFileURL)
                    .components(separatedBy: "\n\n")
                    .dropFirst()
                    .map { Board(string: $0) }
            } catch {
                print(error.localizedDescription)
            }
        }
```
The board is the class that once initialized gets the logic to check if the bingo number gonna win or not.  
I stored the row but I found a way to store the column as well, so I can check with the sets if the row or columns are fully marked. Found this quite nice extension on SO by Martin K to get the columns of a nested array and I used it to simplify my code.
```swift
extension Array where Element : Collection {
    subscript(column column : Element.Index) -> [ Element.Iterator.Element ] {
        return map { $0[ column ] }
    }
}
```
So the final function for the solutions rwill rely on the instance of the boards to do the math. The code is a bit longer but the main func is:
```swift
func day4() {
    var (bingoNumbers, boards) = getInputDay4()
    var solutionDay2a: Int? = nil
    var solutionDay2b = 0
    for bingoNumber in bingoNumbers {
        for board in boards {
            board.addNumber(bingoNumber)
            if board.winner {
                /// to be set only once
                if solutionDay2a == nil {
                    solutionDay2a = board.score
                }
                /// it will be set multiple times - I will keep the last!
                solutionDay2b = board.score
                /// boards will get less and less - the winning are removed- looking for the last winning board!
                if let index = boards.firstIndex(of: board) {
                    boards.remove(at: index)
                }
            }
        }
    }
    print("Solution day2 - Part1: \(solutionDay2a ?? 0)")
    print("Solution day2 - Part2: \(solutionDay2b)")
}
```

## Day 5

I first used a regex to get my inpits mapped. Used a custom struct `Point` instead of the `CGPoint` because I need to make it conform to `Hashable` to use in `Set` instances.  
Using the input file to initialise an array of `Lines`.  

```swift
/// my regex convenience function
extension String {
    func getTrimmedCapturedGroupsFrom(regexPattern: String)-> [String]? {
        let text = self
        let regex = try? NSRegularExpression(pattern: regexPattern)
        
        let match = regex?.firstMatch(in: text, range: NSRange(text.startIndex..., in: text))
        
        if let match = match {
            return (0..<match.numberOfRanges).compactMap {
                if let range = Range(match.range(at: $0), in: text) {
                    return $0 > 0 ? String(text[range]).trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespaces) : nil
                }
                return nil
            }
        }
        return nil
    }
}

```
And once I have an array of `Line` as input I use this to get the intersections:
```swift
func checkIntersections(for input: [Line]) -> Int {
    var intersections: Set<Point> = []
    var accumulator: Set<Point> = Set(input.first!.points)
    for line in input.dropFirst() {
        let intersection = accumulator.intersection(Set(line.points))
        intersections = intersections.union(intersection)
        accumulator = accumulator.union(Set(line.points))
    }
    return intersections.count
}
```
Of course the full code is in the repo but the solution will be :
```swift
let input: [Line] = getInputDay5()

/// for the first part I check only for horiz and vert lines
let lines: [Line] = input.filter {
    $0.orientation == .horizontal || $0.orientation == .vertical
}
let solutionDay2a = checkIntersections(for: lines)
print("Solution day2 - Part1: \(solutionDay2a)")
/// part two checks all of them but the intermediate points in the lines are already calculated in the init of the `Line` struct so it was easy... 
let solutionDay2b = checkIntersections(for: input)

print("Solution day2 - Part2: \(solutionDay2b)")
```
I made a small app in SwiftUI to visualize the lines using the canvas view:

<br></br>

## Day 6

Probably a classic problem of exponential growth. I have been warned at teh beginning that it might be exponential.  
My code at first looked like this, with a iterator returning a new array with each iterator... I passed part 1 easily but part two made my MBP M1 Pro get hot for the first time!  
I realised the solution I had in part 1 was not scalable. I roughly calculatedit would take a day to get the result... Took pen and paper and jotted something. I realised soon that if I put the numbers of the fishes per day in an the array, every iteration would just shift the array!   
So the input example was `[3,4,3,1,2]`, this in a week array where index zero is the day zero etc would give `[0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0]`, and the next day : `[1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0]`. At this point the fishes at position zero would spawn and create a new fish, I crated a kindergarten array for this. It takes 2 iteration to get the young fish to a teenager state from `[0, 0, 1]` , to `[0, 1, 0]` and finally `[1, 0, 0]` at which point I add the kindergarden position zero to the main school array at position 6...
This is the code for my iterator: 

```swift
struct Spawn: Sequence {
    let seed: [Int]
    
    func makeIterator() -> SpawnIterator {
        return SpawnIterator(self)
    }
}

struct SpawnIterator: IteratorProtocol {
    var times = 80
    /// reserving place
    var week: [Int]
    var kindergarden: [Int] = []
    
    var readyToSpawn: Int = 0
    var teens: Int = 0 // the fishes that graduate from kindergarden
    
    init(_ spawn: Spawn) {
        week = Array(repeating: 0, count: 7)
        kindergarden = Array(repeating: 0, count: 3)
        /// init my week array transferring the values from
        for timeLeftToSpawn in seed { week[timeLeftToSpawn] += 1 }
    }
    
    /// lets return a tuple, because at the end I need to count all fishes in both arrays
    mutating func next() -> (kindergarden: [Int], teens: [Int])? {
        defer { times -= 1 }
        guard times > 0 else { return nil }
        /// here the order matters a lot!
        readyToSpawn = week[0]
        kindergarden = kindergarden.shiftRight()
        week = week.shiftRight()
        kindergarden[2] = readyToSpawn
        /// check if someone finished kindergarden
        teens = kindergarden[0]
        /// if so merge with the other fishes at day 6
        week[6] = week[6] + teens
        /// and reset because they do not want to be shifted back to kindergarden day -2
        kindergarden[0] = 0
        return (kindergarden, week)
    }
}

```

for part one:  
```swift
let glowingLanternfishesSchool = Spawn(seed: seed )
for (i, spawn) in glowingLanternfishesSchool.enumerated() {
   print("\(i) \(spawn.0) \(spawn.1)")
    if i == 79 {
        print(spawn.0.reduce(0,+) + spawn.1.reduce(0,+) )
    }
}
```
and part two will be same but using 256 in the iterator and in the loop.
```swift
let glowingLanternfishesSchool = Spawn(seed: input )

for (index, spawn) in glowingLanternfishesSchool.enumerated() {
    if index == 79 {
        solutionDay6a = spawn.kindergarden.reduce(0,+) + spawn.teens.reduce(0,+)
    }
    if index == 255 {
        solutionDay6b = spawn.kindergarden.reduce(0,+) + spawn.teens.reduce(0,+)
    }
}
print("Solution day2 - Part1: \(solutionDay6a)")
print("Solution day2 - Part2: \(solutionDay6b)")
```

Day 8 was hard. I had no idea how to solve it at first. This is a good example how it is important to just start. Part 1 was easy but I was afraif of part 2! Turns out that he gave a hint in part 2! So I managed to solve it. Still it has been a bit of a pain. At first I thought a bijective dictionary was what I needed, then I realised that using the segments as keys, since they can come as "ab" or "ba", I had to save all permutation of the segments for a particular value... So I could then get the value with `dict["ab"]` or `dict["ba"]` :) The rest has been playing with sets subtracting and adding segments...

Part one was just counting the values we already knew. Since there are only 1 digit with 2 led segments and 1 digit with three etc.

```swift
/// part 1!
let solutionDay8a = input.map { $0.b }
    .reduce(0) {
        return $0 + $1
            .trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespaces)
            .components(separatedBy: .whitespaces)
            .reduce(0) {
                if $1.count == 2 || $1.count == 3 || $1.count == 4 || $1.count == 7 {
                    return $0 + 1
                }
                return $0
            }
    }
```

Everytime I find a value I add it to the dict using permutations from the seift algoryths package.  

```swift
/// first pass - the first part of the line, `linePartA`is the list of the 10 digits "codes" I need to decode the second part of the line.
/// The first digits are easy
for segments in linePartA {
    
    let segmentCount: SegmentCount = SegmentCount(digit: segments)
    
    if segmentCount == .two {
        for entry in segments.permutations() {
            dict[String(entry)] = "1"
        }
        linePartA.remove(element: segments)
    }
    if segmentCount == .three {
        for entry in segments.permutations() {
            dict[String(entry)] = "7"
        }
        linePartA.remove(element: segments)
    }
    if segmentCount == .four {
        for entry in segments.permutations() {
            dict[String(entry)] = "4"
        }
        linePartA.remove(element: segments)
    }
    if segmentCount == .seven {
        for entry in segments.permutations() {
            dict[String(entry)] = "8"
        }
        linePartA.remove(element: segments)
    }
}

/// second pass. I can get number `3` The only one which has 5 led segments and is a superset of the segments needed for `1`
/// . Of course `7`, `4`, `3` are already removed
for segments in linePartA {
    let segmentCount: SegmentCount = SegmentCount(digit: segments)
    if segmentCount == .five {
        if Set(segments).isSuperset(of: Set(dict.keyFor(value: "1"))){
            for entry in segments.permutations() {
                dict[String(entry)] = "3"
            }
            linePartA.remove(element: segments)
        }
    }
}

/// get the remaining `5` and `2` which have `5` segments and `5` is found by subtracting the segments used for `3` and checking if it is a subset of `4`
for segments in linePartA {
    let segmentCount: SegmentCount = SegmentCount(digit: segments)
    if segmentCount == .five {
        if Set(segments).subtracting(Set(dict.keyFor(value: "3"))).isSubset(of: Set(dict.keyFor(value: "4"))) {
            for entry in segments.permutations() {
                dict[String(entry)] = "5"
            }
            linePartA.remove(element: segments)
        } else {
            for entry in segments.permutations() {
                dict[String(entry)] = "2"
            }
            linePartA.remove(element: segments)
        }
    }
}

/// get `9` . At this stage the only one which is the union of the elements needed for `3` and `5`
for segments in linePartA {
    let segmentCount: SegmentCount = SegmentCount(digit: segments)
    if segmentCount == .six {
        if Set(segments) ==
            Set(dict.keyFor(value: "3")).union(Set(dict.keyFor(value: "5"))) {
            for entry in segments.permutations() {
                dict[String(entry)] = "9"
            }
            linePartA.remove(element: segments)
        }
    }
}


/// get the remaining `6` and `0`
for segments in linePartA {
    let segmentCount: SegmentCount = SegmentCount(digit: segments)
    if segmentCount == .six {
        if Set(segments) == Set(dict.keyFor(value: "8")).subtracting(Set(dict.keyFor(value: "1"))).union( Set(dict.keyFor(value: "5")))   {
            for entry in segments.permutations() {
                dict[String(entry)] = "6"
            }
            linePartA.remove(element: segments)
        } else {
            for entry in segments.permutations() {
                dict[String(entry)] = "0"
            }
            linePartA.remove(element: segments)
        }
    }
}
```
After this I just get the result using the dict and keep a grand total running
```swift
/// at the end of each line I get the 4 digits using the dict and adding it to the total
var solutionString = ""
for digit in linePartB {
    solutionString += dict[digit] ?? ""
}
solutionDay8b += Int(solutionString)! /// yes unwrapping is safe here :)
```

## Day 9

Ah recursion. It is beautiful when it works :)  
The code is short. I look for the lowest points after padding my initial matrix. Padding allows me not to go over the index. Then when I find a low I add it to the solution for part one and at the same time I start a one liner call to a recursive function which will explore the surroundings for me until there are only 9's around, that is when it returns zero and I stop when all have returned with the amount. Quite nice short code for once!

```swift
var lowPoints: [Int] = []
var basins: [Int] = []
/// after having my input padded with 9's I check the adjacent and look for lowest
for i in 1..<input.count + 1 {
    for k in 1..<digitsInRow + 1 {
        print("\(i) \(k) \(matrix[i].map({String($0)}).joined())")
        // check the four directions
        if matrix[i][k] < matrix[i-1][k] &&
            matrix[i][k] < matrix[i][k-1] &&
            matrix[i][k] < matrix[i][k+1] &&
            matrix[i][k] < matrix[i+1][k]
        {
            print("low point! \(matrix[i][k])")
            /// This for part one of the challenge
            lowPoints.append(matrix[i][k])

            let size = getNextLowRecursive(matrix: &matrix, i: i, k: k)
            
            func getNextLowRecursive(matrix: inout [[Int]], i: Int, k: Int) -> Int {
                /// this is our escape from looping to death
                if matrix[i][k] == 9 { return 0 }
                /// put myself to 9 - already visited
                matrix[i][k] = 9
                ///explore the other lows adding 1 because I had just one low
                return 1 +
                getNextLowRecursive(matrix: &matrix, i: i - 1, k: k) +
                getNextLowRecursive(matrix: &matrix, i: i, k: k - 1) +
                getNextLowRecursive(matrix: &matrix, i: i, k: k + 1) +
                getNextLowRecursive(matrix: &matrix, i: i + 1, k: k)
            }
        basins.append(size)
    }
}
let solutionDay9a = lowPoints.reduce(0) { $0 + $1 + 1 }
let solutionDay9b = basins.sorted(){ $0 > $1 }.prefix(3).reduce(1, *)
```

## day 10

For this one I made three dictionaries to store the different scores and the replacements for chars. I also utilised the `Character` swift type instead of `String`.  

```string
let illegalCharDict: [Character: Int] = [
        ")": 3,
        "]": 57,
        "}": 1197,
        ">": 25137
    ]
    
    let autocompleteScores: [Character: Int] = [
        ")": 1,
        "]": 2,
        "}": 3,
        ">": 4
    ]
    
    let closingCharacterDict: [Character: Character] = [
        "(": ")",
        "[": "]",
        "{": "}",
        "<": ">"
    ]
```
Then I kept a stack with the characters which were not yet closed. Not difficult. Whena row in the inpit revelas to be corrupted I continue to the next row and remove the corrupted row.
I noticed that I am repeating some code but the `continue outer` cannot be pit in a function I believe? Not sure, I could try with a closure maybe...
```swift
var cumulativeStack: [Character] = []

outer:for row in input {
    print(row)
    cumulativeStack = []
    for char in row {
        /// check if opening bracket
        if keys.contains(char) {
            //bracketDict[char, default: 0] += 1
            cumulativeStack.append(char)
            print(cumulativeStack)
        } else {
            /// it has to be a closing one
            if let lastBracket = cumulativeStack.last {
                switch char {
                case ")":
                    if lastBracket != "(" {
                        points += illegalCharDict[char, default: 0]
                        input.remove(element: row)
                        //print("\ncorrupted \(row) \n")
                        continue outer// to next row
                    } else {
                        _ = cumulativeStack.popLast()
                    }
                case "}":
                    if lastBracket != "{" {
                        points += illegalCharDict[char, default: 0]
                        input.remove(element: row)
                        //print("\ncorrupted \(row) \n")
                        continue outer// to next row
                    } else {
                        _ = cumulativeStack.popLast()
                    }
                case "]":
                    if lastBracket != "[" {
                        points += illegalCharDict[char, default: 0]
                        input.remove(element: row)
                        //print("\ncorrupted \(row) \n")
                        continue outer // to next row
                    } else {
                        _ = cumulativeStack.popLast()
                    }
                case ">":
                    if lastBracket != "<" {
                        points += illegalCharDict[char, default: 0]
                        input.remove(element: row)
                        //print("\ncorrupted \(row) \n")
                        continue outer // to next row
                    } else {
                        _ = cumulativeStack.popLast()
                    }
                default:
                    print("not expected this \(char)")
                }
            } else {
            print("illegal char")
            }
        }
    }
    /// here I can deal with the autocomplete
//        print("cumulativeStack \(cumulativeStack)\n")
//        print("\nincomplete \(row) \n")
    var autocompleteArray: [Character] = []
    while !cumulativeStack.isEmpty {
        if let last = cumulativeStack.popLast() {
            autocompleteArray.append(closingCharacterDict[last, default: Character("")])
        }
    }
    print("\nautocomplete \(autocompleteArray) \n")

    totalScoresArray.append(score)

let solutionDay10a = points
let solutionDay10b = totalScoresArray[Int(totalScoresArray.count / 2)]
